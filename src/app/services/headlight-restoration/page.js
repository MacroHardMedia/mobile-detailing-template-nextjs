                <p>
                  We evaluate the condition of your headlights and prepare the
                  work area. We mask surrounding areas to protect your vehicle's
                  paint and trim.

                <p>
                  Using progressive grits, we carefully sand away oxidation,
                  yellowing, and cloudiness from the headlight lens surface.

                  and remove any remaining haze or scratches.
